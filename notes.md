Goal: Audio to Audio in command line

Then into code as a possible API


Audio to Audio

Detect transients - drums (kick & snare)
Riffusion bass without transients - instruments
Separate drums from the rest
Boost transients all the way and add white noise to them (snare may need some tail or decay)
Or replace transients with real drum samples
Possibly arrange segments of instruments

Make sure for instruments to add distortion to it for dnb/dubstep/808 bass sounds
Can make instruments part of the sample generation algorithm
Can add chopped non transients instruments and put them into the pattern loop generator

Can be similar to dance diffusion
